## What You Will Learn
*  [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda)
*  [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)
*  Using the [Skill builder (beta)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/ask-define-the-vui-with-gui)
*  Voice User Interface (VUI) Design

## What You Will Need
*  [Amazon Developer Portal Account](http://developer.amazon.com)
*  [Amazon Web Services Account](http://aws.amazon.com/)
*  The sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-python-quiz-game).
*  [ASK Python SDK](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python)
*  A basic understanding of Python.

## What Your Skill Will Do
The Skill allows users to request a quiz about some simple math questions. They will receive 10 random questions.
This simple "quiz" skill will teach you how the different pieces of the Alexa Skill development process fit together.

We use will use the Skill builder UI to build the Skill although the quiz itself does not employ the new "Dialog-Delegate interface" model.

### Concepts

This simple sample shows how to use render template directives in the alexa 
skill built using ASK Python SDK.
